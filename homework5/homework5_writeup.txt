========================

Equipment Setup: Connected on Pin 1.1 is the positive terminal of the scope. This pin is used to output the clock that is being tripled.
Connected on Pin 1.2 is the positive end of the input clock which is coming from a waveform generator. Evertyhing else is inherent in the 
launchpad schematic. 

Code Elaboration: First off the code shuts down the watchdog and initializes two GPIO's and TIMER0.
