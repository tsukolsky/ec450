Michael Gurr and Todd Sukolsky:

Our idea is a weather system that integrates humidity and temperature.
The microcontroller will take ADC readings for humidity and temperature, 
as well as communicate over SPI to a chip temperature sensor. The 
MSP will then be connected to a Rasberry Pi via UART. The RasPi will run a python
server and upon request the server will ask the MSP for the temperatures and humidity,
receive the data, then send it back to the sender.

Parts used: Thermistor (N channel)
			TI LM95071 temp sensor (SPI)
			Humidity sensor- possibly HoneyWell tech.
			Rasberry Pi and/or TI's BeagleBone
